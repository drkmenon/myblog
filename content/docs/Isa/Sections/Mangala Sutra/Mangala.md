Mangala suthra
 
<!--more-->

## Definition of Object and the Subject

The mangala sutra defines the true nature of both the subjective self and the objects of perception by the word “poornam”. 
### Definition of self
Why self is defined as “poornam” is not explicitly described and hence needs exploration. The very permanent nature of awareness of existence precludes any presumption of a beginning and end. If the self was born or derived from some other substrate, it cease to be permanent. Hence, the very definition presumes that the self is beginning-less and is unborn. Like wise, if it was limited in time and place, at a particular point of time in space it should come to an end. An end means death; something with out birth should not die. Hence, the birth-less and undying self should be immutable and infinite. Such a substance if ever exists should be omnipresent, omnipotent and all knowing. Its very presence prevents the existence of anything other than itself. In other words, by establishing the very eternal and absolute nature of the self the upanishad precludes the existence of any thing other than itself. If every possible point is filled with self, how can something other than it ever exist?. 
### Definition of objects of perception
This logical conclusion throws light in to the definition of the objects of perception. The Upanishad defines the objects of perception also as “poornam” and hence its true nature is that of self itself. 
## The relationship
By the word “udachyade”, it reiterates that the very existence of the objects of perception is a simulation of self itself, with name and form superimposed, which is again immutable and infinite. Furthermore, the Upanishad, using the word “aadaya”, forces one to conclude on an absolute independence of subject, ignoring the contrary concept arising from sense perception. Even if the objects of perception is taken away, the subjective awareness persists. Knowing this one escapes from all the three types of sufferings (namely Aadhyatmikam, Aadidaivikam and Aadibhoudhikam). Hence this manthra is well known as santhi manthra. 

The natural question one may immediately ask is why there is superimposition of name and form on the subject and why self perceive at all? Searching for the answer seems to take one to nowhere as perceptual experience can not be determined either as real or unreal. The first manthra proposes the solution for this dilemma.

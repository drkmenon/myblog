First manthra

Of the three literal senses of vÀsyam, “to be clothed”, “to be worn as garment” and “to be filled”. The first is the ordinarily accepted meaning as explained by Shankara. He proposes that we must lose the sense of this objective universe in the sole perception of the the self, Brahman. Aurobindo draws an image of the world either as a garment or as a dwelling-place for the informing and governing Spirit. Both these presupposes duality and contradicts the very essence of the Upanishad which teaches unity of apparently incompatible opposites. The meaning, to fill inside out, suggested by Vinoba Bhave and Prof G Balakrishnan appears to be more in line with the sense of the Upanishad.

First manthra

<!--more-->



Upanishad reminds the fact that the immutable omnipresent, omnipotent and all knowing self fills (vAsya)[^1] every possible point of perceived objects whether it is moving or not moving. It exhorts to experience the objects of perception and self as one after discarding the desire for names and forms stemming from the belief of their existence independent of self. Using the word “ma-grdhah:”Upanishad warns us against desire. Do not yen. Why? “kasya-svid-dhanam,” whose is wealth?-this (question) is used in the sense of denial, because nobody has any wealth other than self. Names and forms are just superimpositions. The idea is this: By contemplating the true nature of subject and object, i.e., all this objective perception is but the superimposition of name and form on Self, experience it with out any hankering for name and form that are having no permanent existence independent of Self. This solution put-forth by the Upanishad for the perceived duality seems to be two fold but definitely not by searching for the cause of perception. By contemplating absolute identity of subject and object, desire for names and forms, and hence hatred and lust disappears. By reducing desire for names and forms, absolute identity of subject and object becomes more and more evident. Such a conception when practiced in each and every moment will make the mind one pointed and steady, mitigating the grief and deception. If not done so, each and every name & form of the object perceived will produce deep impressions of duality causing lust, hatred etc , leading to endless suffering. 

[^1]: vÀsyam- There are three literal senses of vÀsyam, “to be clothed”, “to be worn as garment” and “to be filled”.

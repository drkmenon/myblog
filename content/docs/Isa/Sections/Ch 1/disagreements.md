First manthra, disagreements

<!--more-->



Sankara and Arobindo again disagrees here. Sankara reads this as, like the adventitious bad odour of sandal, agaru, etc., resulting from moisture etc., because of their contact with water etc., is covered up by their natural smells through the process of rubbing those woods themselves, just so, whatsoever moves on the earth has to be abandoned through the contemplation of the Self which is the supreme Truth. But according to Arobindo, Tyaktena means, through detachment, (and not `by any abandoned thing') ; for, a son or a servant, when abandoned or dead, does not protect one, since he has no connection with oneself. Nor is it possible to abandon things which are not ones own. So the meaning of the Vedic word (tyaktena) is indeed this - `through renunciation of desires’. You who have thus renounced desires, ma-grdhah, do not yen, do not cherish any desire for wealth. Sankara gives the meaning protect for bhuijithah. More natural meaning is to experience. “To experience” used here seems to be more natural than Sankara’s “to protect self “, though both explanations essentially differs minimally especially when the most important point appears to be “renunciation of desires for name and form”

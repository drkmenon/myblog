What the upanishad is trying to achieve

<!--more-->

# Introduction

### Awareness

The awareness of existence is the only permanent substantive present in all three states. Its very existence is the proof of not being non-existent. 
### Nature of awareness
That permanent substantive is well known among sentient beings as subjective awareness “I” and is variously mentioned in the upanishad as atman or self, brahman , prajna, isa, etc. Though self, the subject, perceives everything, it was never perceived. 
### Difference between subject and object
Unlike the subjective self, 5 fold objects of perception seems to be characterized by birth, degradation, death etc. Self which is permanent and it's objects which are open to changes are by nature contradictory. Hence, like light and darkness as described by Sankara they cannot logically coexist. Subject, which is permanent awareness is linked to the ever changing objects by perception. It is established fact that perceptions have got no permanent standards and are entirely dependent on the subject. 
## Why there is awareness
It also seems that one cannot clearly establish why there is subjective awareness, why there are objects and how they are related. This creates difficulty in approaching them, causing grief, anxiety and deception. 
## Why study Isa?
Isa upanishad seems to address this problem of incompatibility of the subject and object and tries to establish a way out of deceit by revealing the true nature of self and the perceived objects.

Second manthra

<!--more-->

There is an immutable linkage between the subjective self and the objects of perception. Every single object perception opens at least three different possibilities: to act, to act-not or to counteract. These possibilities, collectively called karma when performed with desire and there by attachment, brings in lust, hatred etc, causing bondage. Due to ignorance, sentinel beings attribute this bondage arising out of desire, in-turn causing suffering, to karma. The Upanishad using the word “nakarmanalipyade” reiterates that the desire, not karma, is the root cause of all misery. Hence, it advice us to perform karma with out desire, as long as the object perception lasts[^3].

[^3]:Shankara interprets karmani in the first line in the sense of Vedic sacrifices which are permitted to the ignorant as a means of escaping from evil actions and their results and attaining to heaven, but the second karma in exactly the opposite sense, “evil action”. The verse, he tells us, represents a concession to the ignorant; the enlightened soul abandons works and the world and goes to the forest. 

Arobindo reads the line- “Doing verily works in this world one should wish to live a hundred years. Thus it is in thee and not otherwise than this; action cleaves not to a man”. The verse, according to him, proposes that the whole intent of human life is nothing but to work. The whole expressions, constructions and conclusions in both renderings appears forced and unnatural. The rendering I give seems to me the simple and straightforward sense of the Upanishad.
